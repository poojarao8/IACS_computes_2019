# Practice


#### Problem 1: warm-up
Write a function `leap` that determines whether a given year is a normal year or a leap year.

Leap years occur mostly every 4 years, but every 100 years we skip a leap year unless the year is divisible by 400.


```python

```




    False



Next, write a function `leap_years` that tells you which years out of the next `n` years are going to be leap years.


```python

```




    [2020, 2024, 2028, 2032, 2036]




```python

```




    [2020, 2024, 2028, 2032, 2036, 2040, 2044, 2048, 2052, 2056, 2060, 2064]



#### Problem 2: advanced

Write a function which implements [Pascal's triangle](http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.pascal.triangle.html).


```python

```


```python

```

    [1]
    [1, 1]
    [1, 2, 1]
    [1, 3, 3, 1]
    [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
    [1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1]
    [1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1]





    [1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1]




```python

```
