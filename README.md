# Welcome to IACS Python summer camp

Hi and welcome to the website for the **IACS Computes! HS summer camp**. During this camp, students will learn Python programming skills, get to know research challenges for which coding is necessary, and see several real-world applications of coding, including literature analysis, cryptography and data processing. 

- **Dates:** 20-31 July, 9am to 3pm
- **Location:** IACS, Stony Brook University, NY
- **Instructor:** Pooja Rao
- **Helper:** Matt Dannenberg

On this page, you will find information about the [schedule](#schedule), [materials](#materials), and how to [install anaconda](#anaconda-installation).

## Anaconda installation

1. Go to [Anaconda's website](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
2. Click on your operating system.
3. Choose Python 3.7 version. I also recommend checking the box for the "Add Anaconda3 to my PATH environment variable" option.
4. Follow the instructions. 
5. Done!

## Anaconda Online
This should be the last resort. If you are unable to install Anaconda and do not have access to jupyter notebook on your computer, please use the online jupyter notebook from [here].(https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ipython/ipython-in-depth/master?filepath=binder/Index.ipynb).
