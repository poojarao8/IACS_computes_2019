# Welcome to IACS Python summer camp

Hi and welcome to the website for the **IACS Computes! HS summer camp**. During this camp, students will learn Python programming skills, get to know research challenges for which coding is necessary, and see several real-world applications of coding, including literature analysis, cryptography and data processing. 

- **Dates:** 20-31 July, 9am to 3pm
- **Location:** IACS, Stony Brook University, NY
- **Instructor:** Pooja Rao
- **Helper:** Matt Dannenberg

On this page, you will find information about the [schedule](#schedule), [materials](#materials), and how to [install anaconda](#anaconda-installation).

## Anaconda installation

1. Go to [Anaconda's website](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
2. Click on your operating system.
3. Choose Python 3.7 version. I also recommend checking the box for the "Add Anaconda3 to my PATH environment variable" option.
4. Follow the instructions.
5. Done!
