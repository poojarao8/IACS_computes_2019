    "Jupyter notebooks are interactive documents that can contain a mixture of text and code. They are made up of blocks called *cells*. We will be using two different types of cells. The first is called a *Markdown cell*. Markdown cells, when executed (described below), simply become paragraphs of text (just like in a text editor such as Microsoft Word). The second type of cell we will be using are *code cells*. Code cells, when executed, will run the code inside the cell. The easiest way to change the type of cell you are coding in is with the dropdown menu at the top of the screen. \n",
